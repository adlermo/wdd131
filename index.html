        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <section>
          <p>
            My name is Adler, I was born in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. In my childhood
            I've lived in a couple of cities around our state SÃ£o Paulo, and
            after my 8s, we settled in BatayporÃ£, Mato Grosso Do Sul. While
            still there I graduated in High School as a Computer Technician,
            went on a mission and after returning in 2019 I started my BYU
            Degree through Pathway Connect Program. I'm currently living in SÃ£o
            Paulo, where I moved by the end of 2019 to study and work. Here I
            met my wife, we had a kid 1 year ago, and I've been working as a
            Software Engineer since I moved. I participated in many projects in
            a few companies, most of them related to technology in finance and
            investment services.

          <p>
            SÃ£o Paulo is the most populous city in Brazil and the capital of the
            state of SÃ£o Paulo. SÃ£o Paulo is the most populous city in the world
            outside of Asia and the world's 20th-largest city proper by
            population. Additionally, SÃ£o Paulo is the largest
            Portuguese-speaking city in the world. The city's name honors the
            Apostle, Saint Paul of Tarsus. The city's metropolitan area, the
            Greater SÃ£o Paulo, ranks as the most populous in Brazil and the
            12th-most-populous on Earth.
