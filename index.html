        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <section>
          My name is Adler, I was born in S達o Paulo, Brazil. In my childhood
          I've lived in a couple of cities around our state S達o Paulo, and after
          my 8s, we settled in Bataypor達, Mato Grosso Do Sul. While still there
          I graduated in High School as a Computer Technician, went on a mission
          and after returning in 2019 I started my BYU Degree through Pathway
          Connect Program. I'm currently living in S達o Paulo, where I moved by
          the end of 2019 to study and work. Here I met my wife, we had a kid 1
          year ago, and I've been working as a Software Engineer since I moved.
          I participated in many projects in a few companies, most of them
          related to technology in finance and investment services.
