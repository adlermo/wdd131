                <h3>What are the available times for the bus to commute to work?</h3>
                <p>
                    All the available lines operate from 6 AM to 8 PM. During weekdays, all vehicles depart every 20
                    minutes. However, during peak hours, which are from 7 AM to 10 AM and 4 PM to 7 PM, vehicles leave
                    every 5 minutes due to the higher demand of people commuting to work.

                    In-time transport and excellence are key to Brazinfo Commute, but sometimes nature and other events
                    may cause delays. All our vehicles have trackers to provide real-time locations, ensuring Brazinfo
                    employees are always informed about the next bus's location.

                <p>
                    You can request an update to existing lines or the creation of a new line by navigating to the "New
                    Stop" page and filling out the form. Please note that new stops or lines will be considered based on
                    employee demand. If there are enough people to justify the changes, our team will update the lines
                    accordingly.
